# IRIS-HEP-PV-Finding

<p>The runExps script in the Code folder loads 500 events and performs PV finding with 5 different algorithms, and compiles overall results and results grouped by PV type.</p>

<p>Currently the script doesn't save any individual results or the compiled final results</p>

<p>To set the save directory and enable saving of results, change the boolean values that toggle saving, and set the save directory and file names in the script </p>

<p>Ensure that you are running using the fast-nmtf anaconda environment (Follow instructions given here https://github.com/acopar/fast-nmtf)</p>
